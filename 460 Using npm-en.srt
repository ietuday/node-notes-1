1
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:05,190
Let's first of all understand NPM a bit better.

2
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:10,580
It's notes package manager as you learn and in the end it's a Selye a command line interface.

3
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:17,830
We always used it from the command line from the terminal by running NPM and then some command mostly

4
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:24,640
NPM install in this course the idea behind packages or tools like NPM.

5
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:30,520
And every programming language has a similar concept you could say is that we might have some isolated

6
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:38,810
functionality some code that we wrote or did we came up with that does something useful.

7
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:41,130
Let's say it generates a random number.

8
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:47,090
Now we can use that in our web application but maybe we want to use it in other applications as well

9
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:54,280
because this isolated functionality does not depend on our business logic in the project we're creating.

10
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:56,900
Or maybe we want to share it with the public.

11
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:03,910
Well if we want to share it internally or externally we can put it into a package with the help of NPM.

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,650
You can use NPM not just to install packages but also to create and share packages through that NPM

13
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:17,680
repository which is a cloud service where you don't have to pay for where you can host package as you

14
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:23,740
created and does all the service where you will and you can fetch packages from with the NPM install

15
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:24,500
command.

16
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:30,970
So in this repository which is managed globally you'll find the essence of packages obviously and if

17
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:38,680
you now have some node project you can use any of that you can use any of those packages with the NPM

18
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,000
install command frood at school.

19
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:44,550
And that is how you add packages to your project.

20
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:51,760
No matter if that is a package shared by you and you can also have private repositories or private packages

21
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:52,390
on NPM.

22
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:58,360
By the way that is something you do have to pay for but you can always use public packages and share

23
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,990
packages with the public.

24
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,030
That's the idea behind NPM.

25
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:07,840
Now let's have a closer look at the official NPM repository page and Tia waybill commands.

26
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,870
We can use you can visit any IMJ US DOT com.

27
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:14,170
That is the official page of NPM.

28
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:16,210
And there you can search for packages.

29
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:21,500
For example we could search for express here which is of course a package we used the Express framework

30
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:28,160
and then you see all kinds of packages that kind of were found forward and maybe packages that use Express

31
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,090
Maybe all.

32
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,420
Of course the express package itself.

33
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:37,990
And if you click on that you find some quick docks you see the words that were released here.

34
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,850
So here you can see the different words.

35
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:44,950
You could install through NPM you can target a specific word.

36
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:52,630
And by the way by going to your terminal and there with NPM install you can choose to package that at

37
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,660
sign and then a specific work number.

38
00:02:55,670 --> 00:03:01,550
For example we could choose $416 free by typing for 16 dot free.

39
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:06,890
And now we would install that word into our project if we select no word in the latest one is picked

40
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:07,940
by default.

41
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:11,580
That's just a little side note so we can see that word in history.

42
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:14,910
We can see which our package this dispatch relies on.

43
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:19,040
And these packages will be installed for you automatically when you install it expressed.

44
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:19,620
Yes.

45
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:25,610
So DS will also end up in node modules as will the dependencies of these packages and that is why you

46
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:31,280
quickly end up with a big node modules folder by the way because you have a lot of dependencies of dependencies

47
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,590
of dependencies.

48
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:35,530
You also see things like official home page.

49
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:41,630
The get tab repository so the repository where you can find the source code for this package and so

50
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,410
on.

51
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:44,170
So this is really useful.

52
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:49,760
Now if you want to learn more about the NPM command though so what else you can run besides install

53
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,840
or how you can configure install.

54
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:59,100
For example with dash dash save words dash dash save def to install up production or a development dependency.

55
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:04,400
If you want to learn more about that do the official docs are of course the right place there if you

56
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,920
dive in.

57
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:12,360
You can learn way more about NPM and diving deeply into that would really be beyond the scope of this

58
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:19,530
course because NPM creating and managing packages that is a topic on its own not closely related to

59
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:23,600
no changes to language just an additional feature you get for free.

60
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:29,460
So here you can learn way more about that and here on this page if you scroll down a bit further you'll

61
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:32,470
also see all the whaleboat commands you could run.

62
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:40,520
And then if you click on one of them for example on install you also see how you may use it.

63
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:46,160
So here you see a detailed instructions on how you may configure it for example that you can run it

64
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:53,180
in global mode to install a package on your system and not just in a project or that you can of course

65
00:04:53,240 --> 00:05:01,850
also install it with the dash dash save flag save death or save prod which is the same as just dash

66
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:03,090
dash save in the end.

67
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:08,910
So there you see all the ways of configuring that are running that command in different ways.

68
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:11,170
And if you want to learn way more about that.

69
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:18,910
And for most cases you just need NPM installed dash dash save or dash dash save death or dash G.

70
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:24,090
But if you want to learn way more of course these official docs are the place to go.

71
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:31,680
It is worth pointing out that you all can get help here locally when you type NPM help here.

72
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:38,490
You also get instructions on the available commands you may run and you can also get help on a specific

73
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:39,310
command.

74
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:45,400
So if I run NPM install dash dash help here or just dash age.

75
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:53,580
Then I see how I may run this command and also which options I have to add additional flex.

76
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:58,270
However these are just the common options not all options for the full docs of course.

77
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,590
You should dive into the official documentation here.

78
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:08,540
The commands you can run here especially installing are one powerful thing.

79
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,830
NPM allows you to do.

80
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:15,170
You can add any package you want to your project and number important feature is that if you click on

81
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:22,190
using NPM here you can run scripts with NPM and dead and generally is related to that package deal Jason

82
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:30,050
file you get when you put a project under control of NPM what you do with help of d NPM in the command.

83
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:35,070
We also use Statten that course Dad will ask you a couple of questions and then give you a package of

84
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:41,870
Jason File which you can use to configure a project and there you can not only keep a list of your dependencies.

85
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:49,310
You can also add certain scripts and you can run these scripts either with NPM start to run the stars

86
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:53,770
script or NPM run and then any script name you configured in there.

87
00:06:54,080 --> 00:07:01,040
And that is very powerful especially when it comes to using NPM and notorious to build projects.

88
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04,280
It is something I can best show any re-act application.

89
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,600
We worked with in this course.

90
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:12,580
Here I am in that application and there if we had a look at that package dodgiest and fall you see that

91
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:16,540
scripts area and there you see a couple of scripts which you can run.

92
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:20,220
For example start with NPM start but that's a special case.

93
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:27,880
All our scripts with NPM run and then for example of build or eject and then these scripts are executed.

94
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:30,950
Now these scripts actually use a third party package.

95
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,790
So a dependency which was installed re-act scripts we see it here in the dependencies list and then

96
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:42,130
that dependency holds to code that will actually do something and that is the next step I will come

97
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:50,020
back to with no japes being able to run on your machine and not being limited to spinning up a web server.
